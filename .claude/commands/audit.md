Invoke the `evidence-audit` skill with the provided arguments.

If no target argument was given, ask the user: "What file or output would you like to audit for evidence compliance? Provide a file path or paste the content."

Pass all arguments through to the skill:
- The target file path or text as TARGET
- --strict flag if provided
- --source-dir path if provided

After the skill completes:
- If COMPLIANT: confirm evidence protocol compliance
- If NON_COMPLIANT: present violations with line numbers and suggested fixes, offer re-audit after fixes
